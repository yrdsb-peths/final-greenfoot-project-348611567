My game is a simple top-down plane shooter game, where 2 players control opposite colored planes who consistently move forward
and shoot bullets while being rotated clockwise/counter clockwise by the players. Each player will have 3 lives to begin (as indicated
by the heart in the main game) and must destroy the opposing players plane. The game includes sound effects for bullets, deaths and 
victories.
